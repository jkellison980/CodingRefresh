# Coding Refresh

It has been a while since I actually sat down and coded with directed and express purposes. I am going to use this repository to document
the process of me re-learning coding practices and updating my skills. A brief explanation of files will be included below.

## About

The project is in its initial stages so for now it consists of 2 main parts. I am developing files and practicing coding in the src folder,
and developing test cases in the tests folder. For now, the idea is to make a working repository to be able to create characters in a DnD type
setting and being able to pull stats and other information from them.
Technologies used are:
  Python
  unittest

This is useful to document the re-learning process Repository for different races and the attributes they will apply to the character allow for others to recommend paths to improve my skills.

## Features

- Character - main character with all attributes connected. Think of this as the character sheet for DnD
- Races - Repository for different races and the attributes they will apply to the character
- char_classes - Repository for different classes and the attributes they will apply to the character

## Installation

Come back later once I figure this part out...
